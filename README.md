> "Life is too long for just good films"

A delightfully evil movie recommendation system that analyzes your taste and recommends movies you'll probably hate! Now with TMDB API integration for access to thousands of movies.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
- Watching only highly rated films makes us unable to appreciate a films which is well done but doesnt meet your now highly set standards.
- There are only a 100 movies in imdb's top 100 movies and youre eventually gonna have to watch some lower rated ones.
- One can get too comfortable in one particular genre that they never explore other genres to experience it.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
- Existence of Bad films will make us appreciate good films better.
- reccomends genre of films which you're likely to hate.
- helps you break free from the comfort zone!
